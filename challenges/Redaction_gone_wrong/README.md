# Redaction_gone_wrong
*Now you DONâ€™T see me. This report has some critical data in it, some of which have been redacted correctly, while some were not. Can you find an important key that was not redacted properly?*

## Solution
1. Just edit the pdf in some online editor (ex https://www.sejda.com/pdf-editor) and look at the redacted info.
