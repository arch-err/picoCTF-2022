# File_types
*This file was found among some files marked confidential but my pdf reader cannot read it, maybe yours can.*

## Solution
1. The file ain't a pdf, it's some type of script... Let's run that random script, cuz why not?!?! :P
2. Uughh... go through **EVERY FUCKING COMPRESSION ALGORITHM EVER MADE** and decompress all the way to some hex data (think of it like this:  if zippy is a stream of a single color, this is a friggin rainbow)
3. Hex decode, get flag, go to bed...


## Flag
**Flag:** `picoCTF{f1len@m3_m@n1pul@t10n_f0r_0b2cur17y_950c4fee}`
