# Torrent_Analyze
*SOS, someone is torrenting on our network. One of your colleagues has been using torrent to download some files on the companyâ€™s network. Can you identify the file(s) that were downloaded? The file name will be the flag, like picoCTF{filename}. Captured traffic.*

## Solution
1. Realize that the hashes in the `bt-dht` packets are filenames
2. Export all packets with a hash, use vim some vim magic to transform the wireshark export to a list of unique hashes
3. Google the hashes, one hash (`e2467cbf021192c241367b892230dc1e05c0580e`) is the hash of the filename `ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso`
4. Wrap the filename in `picoCTF{}`


## Flag
**Flag:** `picoCTF{ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso}`
